/**
 * A fixed length blocking queue based on the principles of:
 *
 *  http://disruptor.googlecode.com/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf
 *
 * This class could be used where ArrayBlockingQueue would be otherwise.
 *
 * This is a lock free blocking queue that implements
 * a fixed length queue backed by a ring buffer.   Access to the ring buffer
 * is sequenced by iterating a pair of atomic sequence numbers.  One is
 * for the head and another for the tail.
 *
 * When a particular thread would like to append to the queue, it obtains the
 * sequence number for the tail.  When the thread is ready to commit changes,
 * a machine compare and set is used to prove that the sequence number matches
 * the expected value.  In other words, no other thread has modified the sequence.
 *
 * If the sequence number does not match, the operation fails.   If the
 * sequence number matches expectation the thread can continue to operate
 * on the queue's ring buffer without contention.   This check cleverly
 * avoids any synchronization thus the moniker "lock free."   The lack
 * of synchronization results in significant performance advantages.
 *
 * For consumers, access to the back of the ring is controlled by a memory
 * barrier mechanism, namely the "volatile" keyword.   Spin locks are employed
 * to ensure the ring tail cursor is up to date prior to updating it.  Once the
 * ring cursor is updated, the reader/consumer can be assured that there
 * is data available to read.   The consumer thread then employs a
 * mechanism similar to the producer to validate access to the ring.
 *
 * A sequence number for the head of the ring is obtained and when
 * the reader would like to commit the change to the buffer it
 * uses the machine compare and set to prove that no other thread
 * has modified the ring in the interim.
 *
 * This pattern of access is roughly an order of magnitude faster than ArrayBlockingQueue.
 * It is roughly 2x faster than LinkedTransferQueue for similar operations/conditions.
 * Given that LinkedTransferQueue is "state of the art" in terms of Java performance,
 * it is clear that the Disruptor mechanism offers advantages over other
 * strategies.
 *
 * The only memory allocation in this object occurs at object creation and in the clone
 * and drainTo methods.   Otherwise, no garbage collection will ever be triggered by
 * calls to the disruptor queue.
 *
 * The drainTo method implements an efficient "batch" mechanism, and may be
 * used to safely claim all of the available queue entries.  Drain will not
 * perform as well when it is dealing with contention from other reader threads.
 *
 * Overall the disruptor pattern is weak in dealing with massive thread contention,
 * however efforts have been made to deal with that case here.   As always,
 * one should test their intended strategy.
